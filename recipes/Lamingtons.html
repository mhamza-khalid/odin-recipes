        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour a square baking pan.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour and baking powder.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>

        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool completely in the pan, then remove from the pan and cut into squares or rectangles.</li>
        <li>For the chocolate icing, sift the powdered sugar and cocoa powder into a bowl. Add melted butter and milk, and stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>Dip each cake square into the chocolate icing, ensuring all sides are coated.</li>
        <li>Roll the coated cake square in desiccated coconut, pressing lightly to adhere.</li>
